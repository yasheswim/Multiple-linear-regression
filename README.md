Prepared a multiple regression model on three datasets:
1) Toyota Corolla- Predicting the price of the car based on relevant predictors like age, presence of airbags, kilometeres travelled, cc, etc. 
2) 50_startups_data- Predicting the profits earned by these 50 startups in each state. Label encoding performed using dummy library.
3) Comp_ - Predicting price of computer using independent features like ram size, prcessing speed,etc.
VIF(Variable Inflation factor) and AV Plot used to measure multi collinearity among predictor variables. Using hat values to find values causing insignificance in the dataset
and removing them.
